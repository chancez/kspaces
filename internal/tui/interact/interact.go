// Package interact is how the TUI is acted on, as look is how it is drawn: the registry of ADR 10,
// with kinds of subject and the actions on them, places that hold subjects, the targets a place
// makes of its subjects, and the keys bound on kinds and places.
//
// Everything is typed by M, the model actions run against, as in Elm's Update, and S, the subject.
// An Action[M, S] can only be listed on a Kind[M, S], bound on a Kind or Place of S, and run on an
// S, so an action on files cannot be put on a commit, and a place of commits cannot be handed a
// file. The types are erased only inside a Target, which lists a subject's actions and keys
// together.
//
// Actions, kinds, and places have no names. Each is used by its address, so two can never be
// confused, and nothing is looked up by a string.
